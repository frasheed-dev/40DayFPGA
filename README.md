# Note: 
I am trying to do the tool setup for the Raspberry pi OS (64-bit). However, it has never been tested before and I may need to switch to Ubuntu if it doesn't work.

# 40DayFPGA
Learn FPGA Design in 40 Days (30 normal + 10 intensive days exercise)

Current Status: Setup + excerices selection. Since, I am doing this (40day series) along with my full-time job it maybe little bit delayed but I am very motivated to design and finish it. 

Todo: 
- Curriculum
- Setup scripts
